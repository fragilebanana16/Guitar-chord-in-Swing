## 3.Multi-thread

in order to do sth else once you clicked play the music button,you will need multi-thread, override the method run, and your own behavior in it.

## 4.Exception interrupt method to stop the thread
To start with, thread has a method stop() to stop, now this method is deprecated, you will need some tricks to stop the thread, like exception or other methods.
Use interrupt to set bit of the thread then stop the thread, why this bit can cause stop of the thread?In <<Core Java Vol1>> 14.2 the author says exception in thread can cause stop of it.

## 5.Note the habit
.java files should be put in the dir root, .class should be put in dir util,whats more, if you are using javac,java, aka,cmd line to run the code, please dont mix the .class and .java distractedly.



## 6.Potential errors explained
